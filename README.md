MAC Guides
========

MAC Guides are intended to assist in learning Mobile development. Each sample application will have the full source, but there will be instructions available on how to build the project(s) from scratch.

MAC Guide - [Networking](https://github.com/the-mac/Tool-Kit/tree/master/MAC%20Guide%20-%20Networking)
========

Inside of the MAC Guide - Networking folder are 3 projects (2 Network Clients, and 1 Network Server).

The Server is a pure [Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/develop.xml) application, that starts a [TCP](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/T/TCP.html) Server awaiting for connections from its clients. The clients are [Android](http://www.android.com/index.html) and [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/) projects, that can send a message to the Wifi Server that is altered and returned to the [Client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)).
