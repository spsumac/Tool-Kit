MAC Guides
========

MAC Guides are intended to assist in learning Mobile App Development. Each guide will have the full source available, but there will also be instructions available on how to build the related project(s) from scratch.

##Please feel free to join in!
One of the simplest ways to get involved is proof reading our content and submitting suggested changes. And if you're feeling a bit ambitious, you can even create your own guides (i.e., Ruby Server, Windows Mobile Client, and more) based upon our existing ([Server](https://github.com/the-mac/Tool-Kit/blob/master/MAC%20Guides%20-%20Wiki%20Resources/MAC%20Guides%20-%20Wiki%20Server%20Template.md), [Client](https://github.com/the-mac/Tool-Kit/blob/master/MAC%20Guides%20-%20Wiki%20Resources/MAC%20Guides%20-%20Wiki%20Client%20Template.md)) templates.

MAC Guide - [Locations](https://github.com/the-mac/Tool-Kit/tree/master/MAC%20Guide%20-%20Locations)
========

Inside of the MAC Guide - Locations folder are 2 projects (1 Android Locations Client, and 1 iOS Locations Client).

The locations will be a predetermined list of locations (City, Latitude, Longitude) around the world. These locations will be used for directions, showing Street View, and displaying different map view types. 

MAC Guide - [Networking](https://github.com/the-mac/Tool-Kit/tree/master/MAC%20Guide%20-%20Networking)
========

Inside of the MAC Guide - Networking folder are 4 projects (3 Network Clients, and 1 Network Server).

The Server is a pure [Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/develop.xml) application, that starts a [TCP](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/T/TCP.html) Server awaiting for connections from its clients. The clients are [Android](http://www.android.com/index.html) and [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/) projects, that can send a message to the Wifi Server that is altered and returned to the [Client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)).
